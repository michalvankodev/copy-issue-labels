# copy-issue-labels github action

Motivation for creating this action was to copy labels from linked issues to the issue / PR which triggered the workflow.

## Example workflow

This workflow will copy labels from any linked issue for the opened PR.

Github issues can link other issues and this linking is done automatically whenever PR mentions one of the keywords for automated workflows. [See documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword)

```yml
on: 
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  copy-labels:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Copy labels from linked issues
    steps:
      - name: copy-labels
        uses: michalvankodev/copy-issue-labels@v1.2.1
        with:
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

There is also support for different workflows to trigger sync of the labels with `issue-number` parameter

```yml
    steps:
      - name: copy-labels
        uses: michalvankodev/copy-issue-labels@v0.2.12
        with:
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          issue-number: ${{ github.event.inputs.issue }}
```

## Custom keywords

You can provide custom keywords which will be picked up by the parser.

These keywords will not override github specified keywords.

```yml
steps:
  - name: copy-labels
    uses: michalvankodev/copy-issue-labels@v1.2.1
    with:
      repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      custom-keywords: |
        solves
        references
```

## Parse from title

You can provide from-title = true to parse the issue numbers from title

```yml
steps:
  - name: copy-labels
    uses: michalvankodev/copy-issue-labels@v1.2.1
    with:
      repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      from-title: true
```

## Development

The deployed code is stored in the repository as that's how github action runner is able to run the action with _runners_.

1. Don't forget to first build the action before releasing new version
  `npm run build`

2. Commit
3. Create a new git tag: `git tag -a -m "Feature added" v1.x.y`
4. Publish `git push --follow-tags`
